			<h3>Jebril Mohammed - Student, Runner, Developer.</h3>
            <div id="about-educational background">
			<h1><em>Educational Background.</em></h1>
				<p style="text-align: left">I am a 21-year-old second-year undergraduate committed to academic excellence and professional growth. Currently enrolled in my second year of undergraduate studies, I am pursuing a degree in Computer Information Systems, aiming to build a solid foundation in Network and Systems Administration.

				My educational journey reflects a dedication to continuous learning and development. Engaged in a challenging academic curriculum, I am passionate about acquiring knowledge that extends beyond textbooks. I have taken and completed the CompTia A+ course - Core 1 (Hardwares and Software) and Core 2 - (Networking Systems). I am currently working on a frontend project.

				As I progress through my academic endeavors, I am driven by a desire to not only excel academically but also to apply my knowledge to address real-world challenges in the Computer Industry.</p>
			</div>
			<div id="sports and health background">
			<h1><em>Sports and Health Background.</em></h1>
				<p style="text-align: left">Beyond my academic pursuits, I am an enthusiast in the realm of sports and health. I love to run, I play soccer too. My best position in soccer is to play left-back. I am a "gym rat" and love video games. Whether it's maintaining a healthy lifestyle, participating in sports events, or contributing to the well-being of the community, I believe in the holistic development of mind and body.
				  
				  Check some of my sporting archivement in the "impossible list".
				  
				  This dual focus on academic and physical well-being underscores my commitment to a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle. I am excited about the possibilities that lie ahead and welcome opportunities for growth, collaboration, and making a positive impact in both academic and health-oriented spheres.</p>
